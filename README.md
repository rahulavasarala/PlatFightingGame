# PlatFightingGame
This is my first attempt at a platform fighter. 

So far, collision detections with a quadtree and spatial grid have been developed(will implement it with a spatialgrid)

Various Javascript specific features such as title screen switching have also been implemented. 

Working on Character state machines, character inheritance, etc. 

Then will work on moves, hitboxes and a buffer system.
